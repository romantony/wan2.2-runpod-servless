# ComfyUI Extra Model Paths Configuration
# This file tells ComfyUI where to find models on permanent storage

# WAN 2.2 Permanent Storage Configuration
wan2_permanent_storage:
  # Base path where all models are stored
  # Points to permanent model storage on RunPod volume
  base_path: /runpod-volume/models
  
  # Model directories (relative to base_path)
  # All paths below are appended to /workspace/models/
  
  # Main diffusion models (WAN 2.2 I2V, S2V, Animation)

# Notes:
# - This configuration points ComfyUI to permanent storage at /workspace/models/
# - Models in this location are shared across all workers
# - If a model exists both in built-in path and here, built-in takes priority
# - Ensure your network volume is mounted to /workspace/models/
# - This file should be copied to /workspace/runpod-slim/ComfyUI/extra_model_paths.yaml
